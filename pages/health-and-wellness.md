## Health & Wellness
You and your familyâ€™s health is of utmost important consideration for Envoy. If you have any questions or concerns or need support, feel free to contact HR at [team-hr@envoy.com](team-hr@envoy.com).

We have Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) available through Sequoia to help you with these stressful and anxious times. You can find these programs in the Sequoia app to locate Anthem and Guardian EAPs.

Things you can do to support yourself:
- Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can cause undue stress, so consider taking a break from it.
- Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and avoid alcohol and drugs.
- Make time to unwind.
- Try to do some other activities you enjoy.
- Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling.

**Beginning April 1, 2021, all Envoys will be working remotely permanently. In person interactions will be delegated to telepresence robots and carrier pigeons.**
