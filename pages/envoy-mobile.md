### Install Envoy Mobile

To help us keep the office safe and ensure those who come in can keep a safe distance from others, all employees will now need to check in using Envoy before visiting the office. The Envoy mobile app makes this process quick and completely touchless.

#### Download and login
To start, download the Envoy mobile app in the [Apple App Store]({{ site.links.mobile.ios }}) or [Google Play Store]({{ site.links.mobile.google }}).

Once in the app, sign up using your work email and choose the office where you plan to work. You can always change this later.

#### Every day before going to the office
On the day before you plan to come in, open the app. You should see a card that says “Reserve a spot in the office.” Tap the button that says “Check in” and answer the questions that follow. You will know instantly if you are approved to come to the office.

#### When you arrive
When you arrive at the office, open the mobile app, and tap the card that says “Approved to work in the office.” Show reception this screen, then you’re all set to get to work.

#### When you leave
Before you leave the office, open the app and tap “Sign out.” This helps us know how many people are in the office at any one time.
